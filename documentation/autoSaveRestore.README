Autosave/restore  --  save_restore.c v3.2; dbrestore.c v3.0

This software automatically saves the values of EPICS process variables
(PVs), to files on a server, and can automatically restore those values
when the VME crate is rebooted.  The original author is Bob Dalesio; I
made a few improvements; Frank Lenkszus made some more improvements,
which I folded into the version I've been maintaining.  A bunch of
people contributed to getting the software running on PPC hardware,
including Ron Sluiter, Andrew Johnson, and Pete Jemian (APS), Markus
Janousch and David Maden (SLS), and I'm not sure who else.  Mark Rivers

Differences from previous versions
==================================

save_restore v3.2; dbrestore v3.0:
----------------------------------

Previous versions did not reliably save non-local float and double PV
values under EPICS 3.14 

save_restore v2.9a; dbrestore v2.7:
----------------------------------
Previously, create_data_set() would return without releasing a
semaphore (causing the save_restore task to hang) if called with
save_method==TRIGGERED, but no trigger channel was specified.

Previously, fdbrestore() would return without releasing a semaphore
(causing the save_restore task to hang) if called with the name of a
save set currently being maintained, and the save list contained
unconnected PV's, and the variable 'sr_restore_incomplete_sets_ok' was
false.

Added macro-string argument to create_xxx_set()

Added argument 'verbose' to fdblist()

Added second argument, 'subpath', to set_XXXfile_path(). This allows the
caller to pass the path as two args to be concatenated, making it easier
to build the path string using a variable set in the cdCommands file.

Use logMsg() instead of epicsPrintf() for several informational messages.

The variables chlist and reqFilePathList are now private.

Increased ca_pend_io search timeout in connect_list() from 2 to 5 seconds.  
Decreased fetch timeout from num_channels/10 to 10 seconds.

Decreased ca_pend_io clear-channel timeout from num_channels/10 to 10 seconds
in remove_data_set().

Changed call to macParseDefns() to specify the macro-substitution handle.

save_restore v2.7; dbrestore v2.7:
---------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION 
*******************************************************************************
This version is incompatible in one important respect with versions of
save_restore.c numbered lower than 2.6:  The functions
	create_periodic_set()
	create_monitor_set()
	reload_periodic_set()
	reload_monitor_set()
now take 'int' arguments to specify time periods, instead of 'double' arguments.
This change was required for compatibility with PPC processors.

In Frank Lenkszus' version, the calls 
	set_pass<n>_restoreFile()
were required to specify files to be restored.  In this version, if no
restore files have been specified, the code specifies the default files
auto_positions.sav and auto_settings.sav for you, for backward compatibility
with my previous version.  If you really don't want to restore any files,
you now must either not load initHooks, or replace it with your own version.

In Frank Lenkszus' version, set_requestfile_path() could specify only a single
directory.  Now that include files are a possibility, you can specify several
request-file directories by calling set_requestfile_path() several times.

Backup files made as part of a restore operation (i.e., files ending in
".bu", or "YYMMDD-HHMMSS") are no longer created using the VxWorks "copy"
command.


How to use this software
========================

This software can be used in many different ways.  I'll describe what
you have to do to use it as it's used at APS beamlines to save PV
values periodically, and restore them on reboot.


*) Create "request" files (e.g., auto_settings.req, auto_positions.req)
specifying the PVs whose values you want to save and restore.  The save
files corresponding to these request files will have the ".req" suffix
replaced by ".sav".  Request files can include other request files
(nested includes are allowed) and macro substitution can be performed
on the included files (using William Lupton's macro library), with the
following syntax:

	file <request_file> <macro-substitution_string>

e.g.,

	file xx_auto_motor_settings.req P=xxx:,M=m1

I've tried to defend against forseeable variations in syntax, so that
include lines with embedded whitespace and/or quotes, macro strings
without commas, empty macro strings, and lines with trailing comments
will be parsed as one would want.  Generally, quotes are ignored,
whitespace implies a comma but otherwise is ignored, and everything
after the second sequence of non-whitespace characters (i.e., after the
file name) and before the (optional) comment character '#' is taken as
the macro-substitution string.  Macro substitution is performed on the
entire line, so it's possible to parameterize names of included files,
as well as PV names.  It is also possible to define a macro that
replaces its target with nothing.


*) If the request files will not be in the crate's current working
directory ("current", that is, at the time the restore commands are
executed -- during iocInit), specify one or more directories to be
searched for request files using one or more invocations of the
function

	set_requestfile_path()


*) Select the directory in which you want save files to be written.  If
this will not be the crate's current working directory at the time the
files are written, execute the function

	set_savefile_path()

in your startup script, before the create_xxx_set() commands, to
specify the path to the directory.  If you are using NFS (recommended),
ensure that the path does not contain symbolic links.  In my experience,
VxWorks cannot write to an NFS file through a symbolic link.  (I don't
understand all the ins and outs of this limitation.)


*) Give the "crate" write permission to the directory in which the save
files are to be written.  If you forget this step, autoSaveRestore may be
able to write save files, but the files will be corrupted because the crate
will not be able to change their lengths.  autoSaveRestore attempts to
detect this condition, but cannot work around it if the file length must
increase.


*) Specify which save files are to be restored before record
initialization (pass 0) and which are to be restored after record
initialization (pass 1), using the commands

	set_pass0_restoreFile()
	set_pass1_restoreFile()

Place these commands in the startup file before iocInit.  If you don't
call either of these functions (or if your calls fail completely to
specify any restore files) the supplied initHooks routine will attempt
to restore the file "auto_positions.sav" before record init, and the file
"auto_settings.sav" both before and after record init.

Notes:
  Link fields cannot be restored (by dbStatic calls) after record
  initialization.  If you want save/restore to work for link fields you
  must specify them in a pass-0 file.  It is not an error to specify link
  fields in a pass-1 file, but this software will not try to restore them.

  Device support code for the motor record uses the value of the field
  DVAL, restored during pass 0, only if the value read from the hardware
  is zero.  If the value from hardware is nonzero, it is used instead of
  the restored value.


*) At boot time, the restore software writes a backup copy of the ".sav" file
from which it restored PV's.  This file can either be named xxx.bu, and
be rewritten every reboot, or named xxxYYMMDD-HHMMSS, where "YY..." is a date.
Dated backups are not overwritten.  If you want dated backup files
(recommended), set

	reboot_restoreDatedBU = 1

in the startup file before iocInit.


Note:
  If a save file is restored in both pass 0 and pass 1, the backup file
  will be written only during pass 0.


*) Invoke the "save" part of this software as part of the EPICS startup
sequence, by adding lines of the form

	create_monitor_set("auto_positions.req",5)
	create_monitor_set("auto_settings.req",30)

to the end of your EPICS startup file.  You can call the files anything
you want.

For each "create_monitor_set(<name>.req, <time>)" command, the save_restore
process will write the files <name>.sav and <name>.savB every <time>
seconds, if any of the PVs named in the file <name>.req have changed value
since the last write.  Other create_xxx_set() commands do the same thing,
but with different conditions triggering the save operation.

Note that in previous versions, create_monitor_set() used an argument of
type double to specify the period (in seconds).  This doesn't work on the
PPC, so the arguments for this and similar functions were changed to int.

If your VME crate takes a really long time to boot, it's possible the PVs
you want to save will not have the correct values when the save_restore
task first looks at them.  You can avoid this by putting a

	taskDelay(<number_of_60_Hz_clock_ticks>)

before create_monitor_set().


Save files
----------
Save files are not intended to be edited manually.  If you, nevertheless, do
edit a save file, you must end it with the text

<END>

followed by a single arbitrary character (normally '\n').  If the file does
not end with this text, reboot_restore() will assume the crate crashed while
the file was being written, and will not use the file.  Once a save file has
been created successfully, save_restore will not overwrite the file unless
a good ".savB" backup file exists.  Similarly, it will not overwrite the
".savB" file unless the save file was successfully written.

".savB" files are created using the VxWorks "copy" command, which gives
everything it touches the NFS permissions "0640" (read/write for owner,
read only for group, and nothing for other).  One way to work around this
inconvenience is to use the unix chmod command:

   chmod g+s <directory_name>

to cause all files written in the directory to have the same group as the
directory has.


User-callable functions:
========================

int manual_save(char *request_file);
	If a manual save set for the request file "request_file" was created
	with create_manual_set(), this command will cause current PV values to be
	saved.

int set_savefile_name(char *request_file, char *save_file);
	If a save set has already been created for the request file, this function
	will change the save file name.

int create_periodic_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring);
	Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	every <period> seconds.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

int create_triggered_set(char *request_file, char *trigger_channel,
		char *macrostring);
	Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	whenever the PV specified by <trigger_channel> is posted.  Normally this
	occurs when the PV's value changes.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

int create_monitor_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring);
	Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	every <period> seconds, if any PV in the save set was posted (changed
	value) since the last write.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

int create_manual_set(char *request_file, char *macrostring);
	Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	when the function manual_save() is called with the same request-file name.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

int fdbrestore(char *save_file);
	If <save_file> refers to a save set that exists in memory, then PV's in
	the save set will be restored from values in memory.  Otherwise, this
	functions restores the PV's in <saveRestorePath>/<save_file> and creates
	a new backup file "<saveRestorePath>/<save_file>.bu".  The effect probably
	will not be the same as a boot-time restore, because caput() calls are used
	instead of static database access dbPutX() calls.  Record processing will
	result from caput()'s to inherently process-passive fields.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

int fdbrestoreX(char *save_file);
	This function restores from the file <saveRestorePath>/<save_file>, which
	can look just like a save file, but which needn't end in <END>.  No backup
	file will be written.  The effect probably will not be the same as a
	boot-time restore, because caput() calls are used instead of static database
	access dbPutX() calls.  Record processing will result from caput()'s to
	inherently process-passive fields.
	This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

void fdblist(int verbose);
	List all the save sets currently being managed by the save_restore task.
	If (verbose != 0), lists the PV's as well.

int set_requestfile_path(char *path, char *pathsub);
	Called before create_xxx_set(), this function specifies the path to be
	prepended to request-file names.  <pathsub>, if present, will be appended
	to <path>, if present, with a separating '/' whether or not <path> ends
	or <pathsub> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one will
	be appended to it.
	You can specify several directories to be searched for request files by
	calling this routine several times.  Directories will be searched in the
	order in which the set_requestfile_path() calls were made.  If you never
	call the routine, the crate's current working directory will be searched.
	If you ever call it, the current directory ("./") will be searched only if
	you've asked for it explicitly.

int set_savefile_path(char *path, char *pathsub);
	Called before create_xxx_set(), this function specifies the path to be
	prepended to save-file names.   <pathsub>, if present, will be appended
	to <path>, if present, with a separating '/' whether or not <path> ends
	or <pathsub> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one will
	be appended to it.

int set_saveTask_priority(int priority);
	Set the priority of the save_restore task.

int remove_data_set(char *request_file);
	If a save set has been created for <request_file>, this function will
	delete it.

int reload_periodic_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring);
	This function allows you to change the PV's and the period associated with
	a save set created by create_periodic_set().

int reload_triggered_set(char *request_file, char *trigger_channel,
		char *macrostring);
	This function allows you to change the PV's and the trigger channel
	associated with a save set created by create_triggered_set().

int reload_monitor_set(char * request_file, int period, char *macrostring);
	This function allows you to change the PV's and the period associated with
	a save set created by create_monitor_set().

int reload_manual_set(char * request_file, char *macrostring);
	This function allows you to change the PV's associated with a save set
	created by create_manual_set().

Note: Don't get too ambitions with the remove/reload functions.  You
have to wait for one to finish completely (the save_restore task must
get through its service loop) before executing another.  If you call
one before the previous function is completely finished, I don't know
what will happen.

int reboot_restore(char *save_file, initHookState init_state)
	This should only be called from initHooks because it can only function
	correctly if called at particular times during iocInit.

int set_pass0_restoreFile(char *save_file)
	This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit,
	before record initialization.
	Up to eight files can be specified using calls to this function.

int set_pass1_restoreFile(char *save_file)
	This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit,
	after record initialization.
	Up to eight files can be specified using calls to this function.

                                     warning will be written to the console.

int sr_save_incomplete_sets_ok    -- Initially 1.  If set to zero, autosave will
                                     not write a .sav file unless it has a CA
                                     connection to every PV in the list.

int sr_restore_incomplete_sets_ok -- Initially 1.  If set to zero, restore will
                                     not restore a .sav file unless that file
                                     contains a value for every PV.
