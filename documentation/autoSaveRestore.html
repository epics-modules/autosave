<h1 align="center">autosave v4.1.3</h1>

This software automatically saves the values of EPICS process variables (PVs),
to files on a server, and can automatically restore those values when the VME
crate is rebooted.  The original author is Bob Dalesio; I made some
improvements; Frank Lenkszus made some more improvements, which I folded into
the version I've been maintaining.  A bunch of people contributed to getting
the software running on PPC hardware, including Ron Sluiter, Andrew Johnson,
and Pete Jemian (APS), Markus Janousch and David Maden (SLS), and I'm not sure
who else.

<h2>How to use this software</h2>

This software can be used in many different ways.  I'll describe what you have
to do to use it as it's commonly used at APS beamlines to save PV values
periodically, and restore them on reboot.

<ul>
<li><P> (required) Build save_restore.o, dbrestore.o, initHooks.o, and
fGetDateStr.o.  Don't use an old copy of initHooks.o.   Although initHooks.c
hasn't changed since save_restore v2.6, it uses a data structure from
save_restore.h, which has changed, and if initHooks doesn't get recompiled, it
will corrupt that data structure.


<li><P> (required) Create "request" files (e.g., auto_settings.req,
auto_positions.req) specifying the PVs whose values you want to save and
restore.  The save files corresponding to these request files will have the
".req" suffix replaced by ".sav".

Request files can include other request files (nested includes are allowed) and
macro substitution can be performed on the included files (using William
Lupton's macro library), with the following syntax:
<pre>
	file &lt;request_file&gt; &lt;macro-substitution_string&gt;
</pre>
e.g.,
<pre>
	file motor_settings.req P=xxx:,M=m1
</pre>

<P>I've tried to defend against forseeable variations in syntax, so that include
lines with embedded whitespace and/or quotes, macro strings without commas,
empty macro strings, and lines with trailing comments will be parsed as one
would want.  Generally, quotes are ignored, whitespace implies a comma but
otherwise is ignored, and everything after the second sequence of
non-whitespace characters (i.e., after the file name) and before the (optional)
comment character '#' is taken as the macro-substitution string.  Macro
substitution is performed on the entire line, so it's possible to parameterize
names of included files, as well as PV names.  It is also possible to define a
macro that replaces its target with nothing.


<li><P> (optional, recommended) Specify one or more directories to be searched for
request files, using one or more invocations of the function
<pre>
	set_requestfile_path()
</pre>

<li><P> (optional, only on vxWorks) Specify the NFS host from which save files
will be read at restore time, and to which they will be written at save time,
by calling the function
<pre>
	save_restoreSet_NFSHost()
</pre>

<li><P> (only on vxWorks) Use NFS, preferably as described above, or by
including an nfsMount() command in your startup script.  Save_restore is only
tested with NFS, though it has in the past and may still work with vxWorks'
netDrv (ftp or rsh).


<li><P> (optional, recommended) Specify the directory in which you want save
files to be written, by calling the function
<pre>
	set_savefile_path()
</pre>
in your startup script, before the create_xxx_set() commands, to specify the
path to the directory.  If you are using NFS (strongly recommended), ensure that
the path does not contain symbolic links.  If save_restore is managing its own
NFS mount (if save_restoreSet_NFSHost() succeeded), this will be the mount
point, so in this case the path must be specified as it exists on the NFS host. 
<p>In my experience, VxWorks cannot write through a symbolic link.  (I don't
understand all the ins and outs of this limitation.  It may be that symbolic
links are OK if they contain absolute path names.)


<li><P> (required) Give the IOC write permission to the directory in which the
save files are to be written.  If you forget this step, save_restore may be able
to write save files, but the files will eventually be corrupted because
save_restore will not be permitted to change their lengths.  Save_restore
attempts to detect this condition, but cannot work around it if the file length
must increase.


<li><P> (optional, recommended) Specify which save files are to be restored before
record initialization (pass 0) and which are to be restored after record
initialization (pass 1), using the commands
<pre>
	set_pass0_restoreFile()
	set_pass1_restoreFile()
</pre>
Place these commands in the startup file before iocInit.  If you don't call
either of these functions (or if your calls fail completely to specify any
restore files) the supplied initHooks routine will attempt to restore the file
"auto_positions.sav" before record init, and the file "auto_settings.sav" both
before and after record init.

<p>Notes on restore passes:
<ol>
<li><P>Link fields cannot be restored (by dbStatic calls) after record
initialization.  If you want save/restore to work for link fields you must
specify them in a pass-0 file.  
<li><P> Device support code for the motor record uses the value of the field
DVAL, restored during pass 0, only if the value read from the hardware is
zero.  If the value from hardware is nonzero, it is used instead of the
restored value.
<li><P>Arrays cannot be restored during pass 0. 

<li><P>Scalar PV's which have type DBF_NOACCESS in the .dbd file, and are set
to some other DBF type during record initialization, cannot be restored during
pass 0. 

<li>It is not an error to attempt to restore PV's during the wrong pass. The
default strategy, implemented with auto_settings.req and auto_positions.req, is
to use both passes for everything except PV's that shouldn't be restored in
pass 1.  (Motor positions aren't restored in pass 1 because doing so would
overwrite any values read from the hardware.)

</ol>

<li><P> (required) Load a copy of initHooks that calls reboot_restore() to restore
saved parameter values.  The copy of initHooks included in this distribution is
recommended.


<li><P> (optional, recommended) Tell save_restore to writed dated backup files.
At boot time, the restore software writes a backup copy of the ".sav" file from
which it restored PV's.  This file can either be named xxx.sav.bu, and be
rewritten every reboot, or named xxx.sav_YYMMDD-HHMMSS, where "YY..." is a
date.  Dated backups are not overwritten.  If you want dated backup files, put
either of the following two lines to your st.cmd file before the call to
iocInit():
<pre>
	save_restoreDatedBackupFiles=1
OR
	save_restoreSet_DatedBackupFiles(1)
</pre>

<P>Note:
  If a save file is restored in both pass 0 and pass 1, the boot-backup file
  will be written only during pass 0.


<li><P> (required) Invoke the "save" part of this software as part of the EPICS
startup sequence, by calling create_XXX_set() -- e.g., adding lines of the form
<pre>
	create_monitor_set("auto_positions.req", 5, "P=xxx:")
	create_monitor_set("auto_settings.req", 30, "P=xxx:")
</pre>
to your EPICS startup file after iocInit.  You can call the files anything you
want, but note that the file names "auto_positions" and "auto_settings" receive
special treatment: they are default restore-file names specified by initHooks()
if set_pass&lt;n&gt;_restoreFile() were never called.  The third argument to
create_monitor_set()  is a macro-substitution string, as described above in the
discussion of request files.  If supplied, this macro-substitution string
supplements any macro strings supplied in include-file directives of request
files read for this save set.

<P>For each "create_monitor_set(&lt;name&gt;.req, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;macro&gt;)" command, the
save_restore process will write the files &lt;name&gt;.sav and &lt;name&gt;.savB every
&lt;time&gt; seconds, if any of the PVs named in the file &lt;name&gt;.req have changed
value since the last write.  Other create_xxx_set() commands do the same thing,
but with different conditions triggering the save operation.

<P>Note that in versions prior to 2.7, create_monitor_set() used an argument of
type double to specify the period (in seconds).  This doesn't work on the PPC,
so the arguments for this and similar functions were changed to int.

<P>If your IOC takes a really long time to boot, it's possible the PVs you want to
save will not have the correct values when the save_restore task first looks at
them.  (If you are restoring lots of long arrays, this is even more likely.)
Under vxWorks, you can avoid this by putting a
<pre>
	taskDelay(&lt;number_of_60_Hz_clock_ticks&gt;)
</pre>
before create_monitor_set().
</ul>


<h2>About save files</h2>
Save files are not intended to be edited manually.  If you, nevertheless, do
edit a save file, you must end it with the text
<pre>
&lt;END&gt;
</pre>
followed by one or two arbitrary characters (normally '\n' or '\r\n').  If the
file does not end with this text, reboot_restore() will assume the crate
crashed while the file was being written, or that some other bad thing
happened, and will not use the file. Once a save file has been created
successfully, save_restore will not overwrite the file unless a good ".savB"
backup file exists. Similarly, it will not overwrite the ".savB" file unless
the save file was successfully written.

Also, you can comment out lines in a .sav file by beginning them with '#'.

<h2>User-callable functions</h2>

<dl>
<P><dt><code>int manual_save(char *request_file)</code>
<dd>If a manual save set for the request file <code>request_file</code> was created
with create_manual_set(), this command will cause current PV values to
be saved.

<P><dt><code>int set_savefile_name(char *request_file, char *save_file)</code>
<dd>If a save set has already been created for the request file, this
function will change the save file name.

<P><dt><code>int create_periodic_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
every <code>period</code> seconds.
<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int create_triggered_set(char *request_file, char *trigger_channel,
		char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	whenever the PV specified by <code>trigger_channel</code> is posted.  Normally
	this occurs when the PV's value changes.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int create_monitor_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	every <code>period</code> seconds, if any PV in the save set was posted (changed
	value) since the last write.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int create_manual_set(char *request_file, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>Create a save set for the request file.  The save file will be written
	when the function <code>manual_save()</code> is called with the same request-file
	name.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int fdbrestore(char *save_file)</code>
<dd>If <code>save_file</code> refers to a save set that exists in memory, then PV's
	in the save set will be restored from values in memory.  Otherwise, this
	functions restores the PV's in &lt;saveRestorePath&gt;/&lt;save_file&gt; and creates
	a new backup file "&lt;saveRestorePath&gt;/&lt;save_file&gt.bu".  The effect
	probably will not be the same as a boot-time restore, because caput()
	calls are used instead of static database access dbPutX() calls.
	Record processing will result from caput()'s to inherently process-
	passive fields.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int fdbrestoreX(char *save_file)</code>
<dd>This function restores from the file &lt;saveRestorePath&gt;/&lt;save_file&gt, which
	can look just like a save file, but which needn't end in &lt;END&gt;?.  No backup
	file will be written.  The effect probably will not be the same as a
	boot-time restore, because caput() calls are used instead of static
	database access dbPutX() calls.  Record processing will result from
	caput()'s to inherently process-passive fields.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreShow(int verbose)</code>
<dd>List all the save sets currently being managed by the save_restore task.
	If (verbose != 0), lists the PV's as well.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int set_requestfile_path(char *path, char *pathsub)</code>
<dd>Called before create_xxx_set(), this function specifies the path to be
	prepended to request-file names.  <code>pathsub</code>, if present, will be appended
	to <code>path</code>, if present, with a separating '/' whether or not <code>path</code> ends
	or <code>pathsub</code> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one will
	be appended to it.
	<P>You can specify several directories to be searched for request files by
	calling this routine several times.  Directories will be searched in the
	order in which the <code>set_requestfile_path()</code> calls were made.  If you never
	call the routine, the crate's current working directory will be searched.
	If you ever call it, the current directory ("./") will be searched only if
	you've asked for it explicitly.

<P><dt><code>int set_savefile_path(char *path, char *pathsub)</code>
<dd>Called before iocInit(), this function specifies the path to be prepended
	to save-file and restore-file names.   <code>pathsub</code>, if present, will be
	appended to <code>path</code>, if present, with a separating '/' whether or not <path>
	ends or <code>pathsub</code> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one
	will be appended to it.
	<P>If save_restore is managing its own NFS mount, this function specifies the
	mount point, and calling it will result in an NFS mount if all other
	requirements have already been met.  If a valid NFS mount already exists,
	the file system will be dismounted and then mounted with the new path name.
	This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>int set_saveTask_priority(int priority)</code>
<dd>Set the priority of the save_restore task.

<P><dt><code>int remove_data_set(char *request_file)</code>
<dd>If a save set has been created for <code>request_file</code>, this function will
	delete it.

<P><dt><code>int reload_periodic_set(char *request_file, int period, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>This function allows you to change the PV's and the period associated with
	a save set created by <code>create_periodic_set()</code>.

<P><dt><code>int reload_triggered_set(char *request_file, char *trigger_channel,
		char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>This function allows you to change the PV's and the trigger channel
	associated with a save set created by <code>create_triggered_set()</code>.

<P><dt><code>int reload_monitor_set(char * request_file, int period, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>This function allows you to change the PV's and the period associated with
	a save set created by <code>create_monitor_set()</code>.

<P><dt><code>int reload_manual_set(char * request_file, char *macrostring)</code>
<dd>This function allows you to change the PV's associated with a save set
	created by <code>create_manual_set()</code>.

    <P>Note: Don't get too ambitious with the remove/reload functions.  You
    have to wait for one to finish completely (the save_restore task must
    get through its service loop) before executing another.  If you call
    one before the previous function is completely finished, I don't know
    what will happen.

<P><dt><code>int reboot_restore(char *save_file, initHookState init_state)</code>
<dd>This should only be called from initHooks because it can only function
	correctly if called at particular times during iocInit.

<P><dt><code>int set_pass0_restoreFile(char *save_file)</code>
<dd>This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit,
	before record initialization. Up to eight files can be specified using calls to this function.

<P><dt><code>int set_pass1_restoreFile(char *save_file)
<dd>This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit,
	after record initialization.
	Up to eight files can be specified using calls to this function.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_Debug(int debug_level)</code>
<dd>Sets the value <code>(int) save_restoreDebug</code> (initially 0).  Increase to
	get more informational messages printed to the console.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_IncompleteSetsOk(int ok)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreIncompleteSetsOk</code> (initially 1).
	If set to zero, save files will not be restored at boot time unless
	they are perfect, and they will not be overwritten at save time
	unless a valid CA connection and value exists for every PV in the
	list.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_NumSeqFiles(int numSeqFiles)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreNumSeqFiles</code> (initially 3).
	This is the number of sequenced backup files to be maintained.  
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_SeqPeriodInSeconds(int period)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreSeqPeriodInSeconds</code> (initially 60).
	Sequenced backup files will be written with this period.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_DatedBackupFiles(int ok)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreDatedBackupFiles</code> (initially 1).
	If zero, the backup file written at reboot time (a copy of the file
	from which parameter values are restored) will have the suffix '.bu',
	and will be overwritten every reboot.  If nonzero, each reboot will
	leave behind its own backup file.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_status_prefix(char *prefix)</code>
<dd>Specifies the prefix to be used to construct the names of PV's with
	which save_restore reports its status.
	<P>This function must be called before the first call to <code>create_xxx_set()</code>.

<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_NFSHost(char *hostname, char *address)</code>
<dd>Specifies the name and IP address of the NFS host.  If both have been
	specified, and <code>set_savefile_path()</code> has been called to specify the file
	path, save_restore will manage its own NFS mount.  This allows save_restore
	to recover from a reboot of the NFS host (i.e., a stale file handle) and
	from some kinds of tampering with the save_restore directory.
