<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>

Autosave automatically saves the values of EPICS process variables (PVs) to
files on a server, and restores those values when the IOC (Input-Output
Controller &mdash; the business end of EPICS) is rebooted.  The original author
is Bob Dalesio; I made some improvements; Frank Lenkszus made some more
improvements, which I folded into the version I've been maintaining.  A bunch of
people contributed to getting the software running on PPC hardware, including
Ron Sluiter, Andrew Johnson, and Pete Jemian (APS), Markus Janousch and David
Maden (SLS), and I'm not sure who else.  Zheqiao Geng (SLAC) extended the
NFS-mount management to RTEMS, and made other improvements, such as connecting
to PVs that weren't live when autosave was initialized.  I folded those changes
back into a version that preserved the previous API.  Michael Davidsaver (BNL)
extended support for info nodes to nodes of arbitrary length. Lots of other
EPICS developers and users contributed by reporting problems and suggesting
solutions.

<P>Autosave is a two-part operation: run-time save, and boot-time restore.  The
run-time part (the save_restore task or thread) is started by commands in the
IOC startup file, and persists while the IOC is running.  Its primary job is to
save PV values to files on a server, but it also supports manual restore and
other management operations.  The boot-time part (dbrestore.c) is invoked during
iocInit, via an EPICS initHook.  It restores PV values from files written by the
run-time part, and does not persist after iocInit() returns.

<P>In addition to the autosave software, the autosave module contains a client
program, <i>asVerify</i>, to compare written autosave files with current PV
values. This program can also write an autosave file from which PV values can be
restored.  Because one use of asVerify is to retrieve PV values from an IOC that
is having trouble (the save_restore task has crashed, for example), asVerify
connects with only one PV at a time.  This makes asVerify rather slow.  In one
trial, it took two minutes to verify a .sav file containing 5000 PVs.

<P>Autosave also contains a facility, called <i>configMenu</i>, for creating,
saving, finding, restoring, and verifying IOC configurations (that is, sets of
PV values).  configMenu is roughly comparable to the EPICS Backup and Restore
Tool, BURT, but it uses autosave files, and is driven by EPICS PVs, so it can be
used manually, by software clients, and by other IOC code.

<P>Autosave also contains a facility, called <i>autosaveBuild</i>, to generate
autosave-request files as part of the operation of the EPICS functions
dbLoadRecords() and dbLoadTemplate().  This facility requires EPICS 3.15, or
3.14 with a patch.

<h2>Important nuances</h2>
<hr>

<ul>

<P><li>At boot time, autosave uses dbStaticLib to write PVs, just like
dbLoadRecords().  Thus, boot-time restore does not cause record processing to
occur, and it does not make a record's value defined (doesn't set UDF to 0).
<em>Exception: arrays cannot be written by dbStaticLib, so autosave writes
arrays at boot time using database access.  This still doesn't cause processing
to occur, though it should cause the record's UDF field to be set to 0.</em>

<P><li>At run time (after iocInit has completed), autosave reads and writes
using channel-access.  Restoring at run time can produce a different result than
restoring at boot time, because record processing may occur. Prior to
autosave 5.6, arrays were always read and written using database access, which
doesn't cause records to process.  Beginning with autosave 5.6, run time restore
of arrays is done with channel access.

<P><li>Boot-time restore can occur at either or both of two times: before record
initialization ("pass 0"); and after record initialization ("pass 1").  (Record
initialization includes device-support initialization.) For most PV's, you don't
need to think about this; just tell autosave to restore at both times, and
autosave will do whatever is required to get the value written.  You cannot make
this restore-time choice on a PV-by-PV basis; you can only specify when an
entire file of PVs will be restored.

<P>If you want the restored value available for use by device support during its
initialization, you must cause the value to be restored during pass 0.  (Note
that arrays cannot be restored at this time, because storage normally will not
have been allocated for them yet.) If you want the restored value to overwrite
the value written by record/device initialization, you must cause the value to
be restored during pass 1.

<P>Motor-record positions (VAL or DVAL) should be restored only before record
initialization (that is, during pass 0), because this is the assumption under
which motor-record device support was written. 

<P>In the lore that has built up around autosave, PV's that should be restored
only before record initialization have been termed "positions".  All other PV's
have been termed "settings".  Thus, you might run across a file called
'auto_positions.req', and now you'll know that the PVs in this file are intended
to be restored only during autosave's pass-0.

<P><li>You can save PVs without also restoring them, and restore
PVs without also saving them, but you can't make these choices for
individual PVs, only for entire files of PVs. 

</ul>


<a name="How to use autosave"></a>

<h2>How to use autosave</h2>
<hr>

This software can be used in many different ways.  I'll describe what you have
to do to use it as it's commonly used at APS beamlines to save PV values
periodically, and restore them on reboot.  A complete example of how
autosave is used at APS can be found in the synApps xxx module.  The relevant
files in that module are the following:

<ul>
<dl>
<dt>xxx/configure/RELEASE
<dd>look for "AUTOSAVE"
<dt>xxx/xxxApp/src/Makefile
<dd>look for "autosave" and "asSupport.dbd"
<dt>xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/save_restore.cmd
<dd>the whole file
<dt>xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/auto_positions.req
<dd>the whole file
<dt>xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/auto_settings.req
<dd>the whole file
<dt>xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/st.cmd
<dd>look for <code>save_restore.cmd</code> and <code>create_monitor_set</code>.
<dt>xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/autosave
<dd>a directory to hold autosave .sav files
</dl>
</ul>

Here's a step-by-step program for deploying autosave.  Some of the steps
are optional:

<h4>1. Build (required)</h4>
Build the module and include the resulting library,
libautosave.a, and database-definition file, asSupport.dbd, in an IOC's
build.  For example, add
<pre>	AUTOSAVE=&lt;path to the autosave module&gt;</pre>
to xxx/configure/RELEASE, add
<pre>	xxx_LIBS += autosave</pre>
to xxxApp/src/Makefile, and add
<pre>	include "asSupport.dbd"</pre>
to iocxxxInclude.dbd.

<h4>2. Write request files (optional, though this is the intended and most
common use)</h4>

Create "request" files (e.g., auto_settings.req,
auto_positions.req) specifying the PVs whose values you want to save and
restore.  The save files corresponding to these request files will have the
".req" suffix replaced by ".sav".  Here's a sample request file:

<pre>
	xxx:m1.VAL
	xxx:m2.VAL
</pre>

<P>Request files can also contain macro variables, whose values will be defined
in the call that causes the request file to be processed. For example, the above
request file could also be written as shown below, with the macro <code>P</code>
defined by the command <code>create_monitor_set("auto_settings.req", 30,
"P=xxx:")</code>:

<pre>
	$(P)m1.VAL
	$(P)m2.VAL
</pre>

<P>Request files can include other request files (nested includes are allowed)
and macro substitution can be performed on the included files (using William
Lupton's macro library), with the following syntax:

<pre>
	file &lt;request_file&gt; &lt;macro-substitution_string&gt;
</pre>
e.g.,
<pre>
	file motor_settings.req P=xxx:,M=m1
</pre>

<P>I've tried to defend against forseeable variations in syntax, so that "file"
commands with embedded whitespace and/or quotes, macro strings without commas,
and empty macro strings will be parsed as one would want.  Generally, quotes are
ignored, whitespace implies a comma but otherwise is ignored, and everything
after the second sequence of non-whitespace characters (that is, after the file
name) is taken as the macro-substitution string.  Macro substitution is
performed on the entire line, so it's possible to parameterize names of included
files, as well as PV names.  It is also possible to define a macro that replaces
its target with nothing.

<P><b>NOTE:</b> Beginning with autosave 5.1, it's no longer legal to have a comment on the
same line as a file command.  This change was made to permit the use of the '#'
character in a macro definition.

<p>Most synApps modules contain autosave-request files that are
intended to be included in an ioc's autosave-request file(s).  For example,
calc/calcApp/Db/scalcout_settings.req contains a list of the fields one
might want to autosave for a single scalcout record.  This file is
<i>include</i>d in calc/calcApp/Db/userStringCalcs10_settings.req, which,
in turn, is included in xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/auto_settings.req.

<p>Beginning with version 4.3, autosave can generate request files from
<i>info</i> nodes contained in an EPICS database.  See the function
<code>makeAutosaveFiles()</code>, below, for more information on this topic.

<P> <i>Note: Beginning with synApps version 5.2.1, synApps contains software to
generate autosave-request files from information contained in command and
database files. See synApps/support/utils/makeAutosaveFiles.py.</i>

<P> Beginning with synApps version 5.5, autosave contains software to
generate autosave-request files from dbLoadRecords() and dbLoadTemplate()
calls.  See <a href="#autosaveBuild">autosaveBuild</a>.

<h4>3. Set request-file path (optional, recommended)</h4>
Specify one or more directories to be searched for
request files, using one or more invocations of set_requestfile_path()

<P>For systems using <code>cdCommands</code>:

<pre>
	set_requestfile_path(startup, "")
	set_requestfile_path(startup, "autosave")
	set_requestfile_path(area_detector, "ADApp/Db")
	...
</pre>

<P>For systems using <code>envPaths</code>:

<pre>
	set_requestfile_path("$(TOP)/iocBoot/$(IOC)", "")
	set_requestfile_path("$(TOP)/iocBoot/$(IOC)", "autosave")
	set_requestfile_path("$(AREA_DETECTOR)", "ADApp/Db")
	...
</pre>


<h4>4. Set NFS host (optional, only available on vxWorks and RTEMS)</h4>
Specify the NFS host from which save files will be read at restore time,
and to which they will be written at save time, by calling the function
<pre>
	save_restoreSet_NFSHost("oxygen", "164.54.49.4")
</pre>

<P>When autosave manages its own NFS mount, as this command directs it to do, it
can fix a stale file handle by dismounting and remounting the file system.   

<h4>5. Use NFS (required on vxWorks) </h4>

Use NFS, preferably as described above, or by including an
<code>nfsMount()</code> command in your startup script.  Save_restore is only
tested with NFS, and probably will not work with vxWorks' netDrv .

<P>When autosave runs under operating systems other than vxWorks and RTEMS, it
simply uses whatever mount the operating system, or a system administrator, has
provided.

<h4>6. Set save/restore file path (optional, though this is the intended and most common
use)</h4>

Specify the directory in which you want .sav files to be written, by calling the function

<pre> set_savefile_path("/full/path") </pre>

in your startup script, before the <code>create_xxx_set()</code> commands, to
specify the path to the directory.  If you are using NFS (strongly recommended),
ensure that the path does not contain symbolic links.  In my experience, VxWorks
cannot write through a symbolic link.  (I don't understand all the ins and outs
of this limitation.  It may be that symbolic links are OK if they contain
absolute path names.)

<P>Beginning with autosave v4.3, you can also specify the path and/or
filename, to which an autosave <tt>.sav</tt> file is to be written, with
an EPICS PV. See the documentation of <tt>create_xxx_set()</tt> for details. 


<h4>7. Give the ioc write permission to the autosave directory (required)</h4>
Give the IOC write permission to the directory in which the save
files are to be written.  If you forget this step, save_restore may be able to
write save files, but the files will be corrupted because save_restore will not
be permitted to change their lengths.  Save_restore attempts to detect this
condition, but cannot work around it if the file length must increase.

<h4>8. Specify restore files (optional, though this is the intended and most common use)</h4>

Specify which save files are to be restored before record initialization (pass 0)
and which are to be restored after record initialization (pass 1), using the
commands set_pass&lt;N&gt;_restoreFile(), as in this example:

<pre>
	set_pass0_restoreFile("auto_settings.req", "P=xxx:")
	set_pass1_restoreFile("auto_settings.req", "P=xxx:")
</pre>

(Note "macrostring" is optional, and a new feature of autosave 5.4.)

<P>Place these commands in the startup file before <code>iocInit</code>.  In versions earlier
than 4.4, autosave would attempt to restore  "auto_positions.sav" and "auto_settings.sav", if
no restore files had been specified.  Beginning with version 4.5, only files specified in
calls to set_pass<i>n</i>_restoreFile() are restored.

<P>If you specify only a file name, not a path, to set_pass&lt;n&gt;_restoreFile(), autosave
will prepend the path specified in set_savefile_path().  This is the most common way to
specify a restore file.

<P>Beginning with autosave 5.4, if you specify a full path beginning with '/', autosave will
not prepend anything to it.  (Also, autosave will not write a restore-time backup of the file
in this case.) 

<P>To disable boot-time restore completely, delete or comment out all
<code>set_pass<i>n</i>_restoreFile()</code> calls.

<p>Notes on restore passes:
<ol>
<li><P>Link fields cannot be restored (by dbStatic calls) after record
initialization.  If you want save/restore to work for link fields you must
specify them in a pass-0 file.  
<li><P> Device support code for the motor record uses the value of the field
DVAL, restored during pass 0, only if the value read from the hardware is
zero.  If the value from hardware is nonzero, it is used instead of the
restored value.
<li><P>Arrays cannot be restored during pass 0. 

<li><P>Scalar PV's that have type DBF_NOACCESS in the .dbd file, and are set
to some other DBF type during record initialization, cannot be restored during
pass 0. 

<li>It is not an error to attempt to restore PV's during the wrong pass. The
default strategy, implemented with auto_settings.req and auto_positions.req, is
to use both passes for everything except PV's that shouldn't be restored in
pass 1.  (Motor positions aren't restored in pass 1 because doing so would
overwrite any values read from the hardware.)

</ol>

<h4>9. Load initHook routine (required for boot-time restore)</h4>
Load a copy of initHooks that calls reboot_restore() to restore
saved PV values.  The copy of initHooks included in this distribution is
recommended.  This will happen automatically if the ioc's executable is built
as described above.

<h4>10. Select save-file options (optional, recommended)</h4>
<ul>

<li>Tell save_restore to writed dated backup files. At boot time, the restore
software writes a backup copy of the ".sav" file from which it restored PV's. 
This file can either be named xxx.sav.bu, and be rewritten every reboot, or be
named xxx.sav_YYMMDD-HHMMSS, where "YY..." is a date.  Dated backups are not
overwritten.  If you want dated backup files, put the following line in your
st.cmd file before the call to iocInit():

<pre>
	save_restoreSet_DatedBackupFiles(1)
</pre>

<P>Note:
  If a save file is restored in both pass 0 and pass 1, the boot-backup file
  will be written only during pass 0.

<P><li>Tell save_restore to save sequence files.  The
commands:

<pre>
	save_restoreSet_NumSeqFiles(3)
	save_restoreSet_SeqPeriodInSeconds(600)
</pre>

will cause save_restore to maintain three copies of each .sav file, at
ten-minute intervals.  Note: if autosave fails to write the .sav file, it will
stop making sequence copies until it again succeeds.

<P><li>Specify the time delay between a failed .sav-file write and the retry of
that write.  The default delay is 60 seconds.  If list-PV's change during the
delay, the new values will be written.

<pre>
	save_restoreSet_RetrySeconds(60)
</pre>


<P><li>Specify whether autosave should periodically retry connecting to PVs
whose initial connection attempt failed.  Currently, the connection-retry
interval is hard-wired at 60 seconds.

<pre>
	save_restoreSet_CAReconnect(1)
</pre>

<P><li>Specify the time interval in seconds between forced save-file writes. 
(-1 means forever). This is intended to get save files written even if the
normal trigger mechanism is broken.

<pre>
	save_restoreSet_CallbackTimeout(-1)
</pre>

</ul>

<h4>11. Start the save task (required to save files)</h4>
Invoke the "save" part of this software as part of the EPICS
startup sequence, by calling create_XXX_set() &mdash; e.g., adding lines of the form
<pre>
	create_monitor_set("auto_positions.req", 5, "P=xxx:")
	create_monitor_set("auto_settings.req", 30, "P=xxx:")
</pre>

to your EPICS startup file after iocInit.  The third argument to
<code>create_monitor_set()</code>  is a macro-substitution string, as described
above in the discussion of request files (step 2).  If supplied, this
macro-substitution string supplements any macro strings supplied in include-file
directives of request files read for this save set.

<blockquote> <i>Note: if you want to start the save task without also creating a save set, you
can call <code>create_monitor_set()</code> with no arguments.
</i></blockquote>

<P>The macro string can also be used to override the default path and name to
which the <tt>.sav</tt> file will be written.  If the macro
<tt>SAVEPATHPV=&lt;pv-name&gt;</tt> is included, autosave will write the
<tt>.sav</tt> file to the path read from the EPICS PV &lt;pv-name&gt;, instead
of writing to the path specified in <tt>set_savefile_path()</tt>. If the macro
<tt>SAVENAMEPV=&lt;pv-name&gt;</tt> is included, autosave will write the
<tt>.sav</tt> file to the filename read from the EPICS PV &lt;pv-name&gt;.
(By default, the <tt>.sav</tt> file name is the request-file name, with <tt>.req</tt>
replaced by <tt>.sav</tt>.)

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b>  If either <tt>SAVEPATHPV</tt> or <tt>SAVENAMEPV</tt> occurs in
the macro string, autosave will not attempt to save backup or sequence files for
the save set.
</blockquote>


<P>For each <code>create_monitor_set(&lt;name&gt;.req, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;macro&gt;)</code> command, the
save_restore process will write the files &lt;name&gt;.sav and &lt;name&gt;.savB every
&lt;time&gt; seconds, if any of the PVs named in the file &lt;name&gt;.req have changed
value since the last write.  Other <code>create_xxx_set()</code> commands do the same thing,
but with different conditions triggering the save operation.

<P>Note that in versions prior to 2.7, <code>create_monitor_set()</code> used an
argument of type double to specify the period (in seconds).  This doesn't work on
PowerPC processors, under vWorks, so the arguments for this and similar functions
were changed to int.

<P>If your IOC takes a really long time to boot, it's possible the PVs you want to
save will not have the correct values when the save_restore task first looks at
them.  (If you are restoring lots of long arrays, this is even more likely.)
Under vxWorks, you can avoid this by putting a
<pre>
	taskDelay(&lt;number_of_60_Hz_clock_ticks&gt;)
</pre>
before <code>create_monitor_set()</code>.

<a name="autosaveBuild"></a>

<h2>autosaveBuild (automatic request-file generation)</h2>
<hr>

<P> Note: this facility requires an EPICS base version higher than 3.15.0.2, or
a patch to EPICS base 3.14.  To enable the code in autosave, you must edit
asApp/src/Makefile, and uncomment the line
<pre>
#USR_CFLAGS += -DDBLOADRECORDSHOOKREGISTER
</pre>

<P>Many of the databases in synApps have associated autosave-request files.  For
example, the calc module contains <code>editSseq.db</code> and
<code>editSseq_settings.req</code>.  When adding a new database to an IOC, it's
common practice to add the associated request file to
<code>auto_settings.req</code> and/or <code>auto_positions.req</code>.  For
clarity, <code>st.cmd</code> contains this:

<blockquote><pre>
dbLoadRecords("$(CALC)/calcApp/Db/editSseq.db", "P=xxxL:,Q=ES:")
</pre></blockquote>

and <code>auto_settings.req</code> contains this:

<blockquote><pre>
file editSseq_settings.req P=xxxL:,Q=ES:
</pre></blockquote>

<P>It's tedious and error prone to have these entries separately maintained, so
autosave can do the request-file part for you.  To do this, you tell autosave
to arrange to be called whenever <code>dbLoadRecords()</code> is called (note
that <code>dbLoadTemplate()</code> calls <code>dbLoadRecords()</code>), you
tell it how to make a request-file name from a database-file name, and you give
it the name of the request file you want it to build.  You can do this with
the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
autosaveBuild("built_settings.req", "_settings.req", 1)
</pre></blockquote>

This tells autosave to do the following:

<ol> <li>Begin building the file <code>built_settings.req</code>.  If this is
the first call that mentions <code>built_settings.req</code>, erase the file.

<li>Generate request-file names by stripping ".db", or ".vdb", or ".template"
from database-file names, and adding the suffix "_settings.req".

<li>Enable (disable) automated building if the third argument is 1 (0).

</ol>

While automated building is enabled, autosave will generate request-file names
and search for those files in its request-file path.  If it finds a request
file, it will add the appropriate line to <code>built_settings.req</code>.

<P>All this does is get the file <code>built_settings.req</code> built.  If you
want it to be used, you must add the following line to
<code>auto_settings.req</code>:

<blockquote><pre>
file built_settings.req P=$(P)
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can specify more than one request-file suffix by making multiple
calls to <code>autosaveBuild()</code>:

<pre>
autosaveBuild("built_settings.req", "_settings.req", 1)
autosaveBuild("built_settings.req", ".req", 1)
</pre>

After these calls, the request-file name for <code>abc.db</code> can be
either <code>abc_settings.req</code> or <code>abc.req</code>.  If both are
found, lines for both will be added to <code>built_settings.req</code>.

<li><P>You can disable file/suffix combinations separately:
<dl>
<dt><pre>
autosaveBuild("built_settings.req", "_settings.req", 0)
</pre>
<dd>disables searching for request files ending in "_settings.req" for <code>built_settings.req</code>.

<dt><pre>
autosaveBuild("built_settings.req", "*", 0)
</pre>
<dd>disables searching for all request files for <code>built_settings.req</code>.
</dl>

<li><P>You can also add a line to <code>built_settings.req</code> yourself:
<pre>
appendToFile("built_settings.req", '$(P)userStringSeqEnable')
</pre>

Note the use of single quotes.  This is for iocsh, because it will not accept
failure to expand the macro <code>$(P)</code>, and single quotes tells it to
not do macro expansion.

</ul>

<h2>asVerify</h2>
<hr>

Autosave is not completely bulletproof.  Most APS beamlines have at least one
autosave related problem every year.  If autosave fails, you might be able to
detect it, or work around it, using asVerify.  This client-side program reads an
autosave .sav file and independently verifies that the values it contains agree
with current PV values.  The program can also be used to write a .sav file,
given a list of PVs.  The list of PVs is normally an autosave .sav file, but a
file containing nothing but PV names, one per line, would also work. 

Here's asVerify's command line:
<pre>
usage: asVerify [-vrd] &lt;autosave_file&gt;
         -v (verbose) causes all PV's to be printed out
             Otherwise, only PV's whose values differ are printed.
         -r (restore_file) causes a restore file named
            '&lt;autosave_file&gt;.asVerify' to be written.
         -d (debug) increment debug level by one.
         -rv (or -vr) does both
examples:

    asVerify auto_settings.sav
        (reports only PVs whose values differ from saved values)

    asVerify -v auto_settings.sav
        (reports all PVs, marking differences with '***'.)

    asVerify -vr auto_settings.sav
        (reports all PVs, and writes a restore file.)

    asVerify auto_settings.sav
    caput &lt;myStatusPV&gt; $?
        (writes number of differences found to a PV.)

</pre>

<P>Note that asVerify cannot read an autosave request file; it will understand
any PV names contained in the file, but it cannot parse the "file" command,
perform macro substitutions, or include other request files.

<P>Beginning with autosave R5.6.1, asVerify can be called from the IOC console:
<pre>
asVerify(char *fileName, int verbose, char *restoreFileName)
</pre>
Examples:

<dl>
<dt>
<pre>
asVerify("auto_settings.sav")
</pre>

<dd><P>This will print out differences.

<dt>
<pre>
asVerify("auto_settings.sav",0,"junk.sav")
</pre>

<dd><P>This will print out differences and write "junk.sav" in the IOC's current directory.

<h2>configMenu</h2>
<hr>

<i>configMenu</i> is a facility for creating, saving, finding, restoring, and
verifying sets of EPICS PVs ("configurations") on a running IOC.  It is roughly
comparable to the EPICS Backup and Restore Tool, BURT, but it saves
configurations as autosave files, and is driven by and reports back to EPICS PVs,
so it can be used manually, driven by any CA client, or driven by IOC-resident
code.  configMenu operations can be driven by a ca_put_callback to an EPICS PV,
so the loading and saving of a configuration can usefully be driven as part of a
larger sequence of operations.  For example, any EPICS record that can do a
ca_put_callback can load or save a configuration and wait for the operation to
complete before perhaps triggering additional execution.

<P><b>New in autosave R5-7:</b> The number of configurations that a configMenu instance
can handle used to be 10, but is now unlimited.  If more than ten configurations
are found, you can page through the list, ten configurations at a time.

<h3>Example</h3>

<P>Suppose we want to configure a set of three sscan records to perform one of
many different types of scans.  Here are the steps needed to implement a menu of
scan types, and to give the user a GUI display for creating scan types and
loading them.  (In the following, <font color="blue">scan1</font> is the name of
this instance of configMenu.  The files it loads and saves will be named "<font
color="blue">scan1</font>_&lt;<i>config Name</i>&gt;.cfg".)

<blockquote> <ol> <li>Create an autosave request file, which I'll call "<font
color="blue">scan1</font>Menu.req", with the following content:

<pre>
file configMenu.req P=$(P),CONFIG=$(CONFIG)
file scan_settings.req P=$(P),S=scan2
file scan_settings.req P=$(P),S=scan1
file scan_settings.req P=$(P),S=scanH
</pre>

<blockquote>This is required only if <font color="blue">scan1</font> config
files are to be written at run time.</blockquote>

<li>Add the following lines to <code>st.cmd</code>:

<P><code>dbLoadRecords("$(AUTOSAVE)/asApp/Db/configMenu.db","P=xxx:,CONFIG=<font color="blue">scan1</font>")</code>

<blockquote>This goes before <code>iocInit</code>.  You can disable the saving
of <font color="blue">scan1</font> config files by specifying the macro
<code>ENABLE_SAVE=0</code>.</blockquote>

<P><code>create_manual_set("<font color="blue">scan1</font>Menu.req","P=xxx:,CONFIG=<font color="blue">scan1</font>,CONFIGMENU=1")</code>

<blockquote>This goes after <code>iocInit</code>, and is required only if you
intend for <font color="blue">scan1</font> config files to be written at run
time, or if you need to have macro substitution performed on a <font
color="blue">scan1</font> config file to be loaded.  The macro
<code>CONFIGMENU</code> tells autosave to refrain from writing backup (.savB)
and sequence (.sav1, .sav2, etc.) files for this save set.</blockquote>

<li>Add an MEDM related-display entry to bring up a configMenu*.adl display.

<pre>
label="scan1Menu"
name="configMenu.adl"
args="P=xxx:,CONFIG=<font color="blue">scan1</font>"
</pre>

<li> If all of the PVs in a configuration are being autosaved, and you want the
current configuration name and description, and the <code>enableSave</code>
selection also to be autosaved, add the following line to auto_settings.req:
<pre> file configMenu_settings.req P=$(P),CONFIG=<font color="blue">scan1</font>
</pre>

<blockquote>I'm not sure this is really a great idea, because the autosaved
values aren't guaranteed to be the same as the values in the .cfg file.  (The
user might have loaded a .cfg file and then made some changes, for example.) 
But it's disconcerting for a user to reboot the ioc and not have everything come
back just as it was, so I normally do this.</blockquote>

</ol>
</blockquote>

Here an example of what the user might see:

<P><table width="100%">
<tr>
<td><center><IMG SRC="configMenu_small.adl.jpg" NAME="configMenu_small.adl">
<br>configMenu_small.adl
<td><center><IMG SRC="configMenu.adl.jpg" NAME="configMenu.adl">
<br>configMenu.adl
<td><center><IMG SRC="configMenu_more.adl.jpg" NAME="configMenu_more.adl">
<br>configMenu_more.adl
</tr>
</table>

<P>In <b>configMenu_small.adl</b>, the menu of configurations is displayed by
and selected from the <i>enum</i> PV, <code>$(P)$(CONFIG)Menu</code>, (e.g.,
<code>xxx:scan1Menu</code>).  This display cannot cause a configuration to be written. 
When the menu is repopulated, or a new page is selected, MEDM will not
automatically retrieve the new names for display by
<code>$(P)$(CONFIG)Menu</code>.  This must be done manually, by closing and
reopening the display, which is what the "Refresh menu choices" button does.

<P>Previously, <code>$(P)$(CONFIG)Menu</code> was a convenient PV for driving
configMenu from CA-client software, because it both selected a configuration and
caused the configuration to load.  This no longer works if the configuration
name is not on the displayed page.  Beginning with R5-7, in which the number of
supported configurations is unlimited, CA clients can load a configuration by
writing its name to <code>$(P)$(CONFIG)Menu:name</code>

<P><b>configMenu.adl</b> and <b>configMenu_more.adl</b> show the menu choices as
separate PVs, for which no manual refresh is needed, and provide buttons for
loading and saving configurations, and for paging through the list of available
configuration files, if there are more than 10.

<P><b>configMenu_more.adl</b> also shows description PVs. When the menu is
populated by searching for config files, descriptions are extracted from those
files.  Otherwise, if configMenuNames.req is included in an autosave-request
file, names and descriptions will be restored at boot time.  If the
<code>enableSave</code> PV (labelled "permit save?") has the value "No" (0), the
"Save" buttons will not be displayed, and users will not be able to save
configuration files.

<h3>Details</h3>

<ol>

<li>Configuration names in the display, configMenu.adl (e.g., "align entrance
slit") will correspond with autosave ".cfg" files whose names are similar, but
with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by '_' (e.g., "<font
color="blue">scan1</font>_align_entrance_slit.cfg").  A ".cfg" file is exactly
like a ".sav" file; the ".cfg" extension is purely to make them easier to find
and distinguish from ".sav" files.

<blockquote>You don't want to make two configurations
whose names differ only in non-alphanumeric characters; configMenu will
gleefully treat them as the same configuration.</blockquote>

<li>configMenu_small.adl has a problem when the menu of config files changes:
MEDM doesn't monitor the menu (enum) strings, so the display must be closed and
reopened when they change.  That's what the "Refresh menu choices" button is
for.  (Channel access clients that specify the event-type flag
<code>DBE_PROPERTY</code> when they subscribe to an enum PV will be notified
when the enum strings change.)

<li>configMenu can save and restore most kinds of PVs from other IOCs, but
currently it can't handle array or long-string PVs in a remote IOC.  If you
use configMenu for remote PVs, you should tell autosave to retry connections
periodically, by including the following line in save_restore.cmd:

<pre>
save_restoreSet_CAReconnect(1)
</pre>

<li>When configMenu overwrites an existing .cfg file, it makes a backup copy
of the current version, named <i>filename</i>_YYMMDD-HHMMSS.  For example:
scan1_blank.cfg_130401-140546 was written at 2:05:46 PM on April 1, 2013.

<li>You can load .cfg files that contain macros.  For example, softGlue
standard example circuits can be loaded without modification into any softGlue
instance by specifying macros as follows:
<br><code>
create_manual_set("SGMenu.req","P=xxx:,CONFIG=SG,CONFIGMENU=1,H=softGlue:")
</code><br>
where the macros "P" and "H" agree with their definitions in softGlue.cmd.

<li> configMenu needs to get a directory listing to search the autosave
directory for .cfg files.  At APS, we've encountered a problem using nfs3Drv
with vxWorks 5.5.2 to talk to a linux-hosted file server.  The source and nature
of the problem are not thoroughly understood, but one symptom is that directory
listings don't work. For example, typing "ls" at the ioc's console prompt yields
the following error message:

<pre>
error reading dir &lt;mydirectoryname&gt; errno: 0x300016
</pre>

One solution is to modify the board-support package to use nfs2Drv.

</ol>

<a name="About save files"></a>
<hr>
<h2>About save files</h2>
<hr>

PV values in a save file have been converted to strings, in most cases simply by
having been read as strings &mdash; e.g., <code>ca_get(DBR_STRING,...)</code>.
Most data types are read using channel access and written using dbStaticLib
calls.  Four data types get special attention: <dl> <dt>double <dd>read as
double, converted to string with the format "%.14g".  (Otherwise, the record's
.PREC field would limit the precision.) <dt>float <dd>Same as double, but the
format is "%.7g". <dt>menu and enum

<dd>Menu and enum are integer data types with values restricted to the set
(0,1,...N), where 'N' depends on the PV, but is usually 15 or smaller.  EPICS
associates a string with each number in the set, and permits clients to use
either the number or the string.  For menu PV's, the strings are specified in a
.dbd file; for enum PV's, the strings can be specified in a database file,
and they can be modified at run time.

<P>Channel access does not distinguish these types, so neither does autosave.
Autosave cannot write enums as strings, because enum strings may not have been
defined at the time they must be restored.

<dt>arrays of any kind

<dd>Arrays are read using database access.  Channel access cannot read only the
defined portion of an array, dbStaticLib cannot write an array. (However,
asVerify uses channel access to read arrays.)  At boot time, autosave uses
database access to write arrays, but at runtime, it uses channel access
(beginning with autosave 5.6). </dl>

</pre>

Save files are not intended to be edited manually.  If you, nevertheless, do
edit a save file, you must end it with the text
<pre>
&lt;END&gt;
</pre>
followed by one or two arbitrary characters (normally '\n' or '\r\n').  If the
file does not end with this text, reboot_restore() will assume the crate
crashed while the file was being written, or that some other bad thing
happened, and will not use the file. Once a save file has been created
successfully, save_restore will not overwrite the file unless a good ".savB"
backup file exists. Similarly, it will not overwrite the ".savB" file unless
the save file was successfully written.

<P>You can comment out lines in a .sav file by beginning them with '#'.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_Debug(int debug_level)</code>
<dd>Sets the value <code>(int) save_restoreDebug</code> (initially 0).  Increase to
	get more informational messages printed to the console.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_FilePermissions(int permissions)</code>

<dd>Specify the file permissions used to create new .sav files.  This integer
	value will be supplied, exactly as given, to the system call,
	<tt>open()</tt>, and to the call fchmod().  Typically, file permissions are
	set with an octal number, such as 0640, and
	<tt>save_restoreSet_FilePermissions()</tt> will confirm any number given to
	it by echoing it to the console as an octal number.

	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_IncompleteSetsOk(int ok)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreIncompleteSetsOk</code> (initially 1).
	If set to zero, save files will not be restored at boot time unless
	they are perfect, and they will not be overwritten at save time
	unless a valid CA connection and value exists for every PV in the
	list.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_NFSHost(char *hostname, char *address)</code>

<dd>Specifies the name and IP address of the NFS host.  If both have been
	specified, and <code>set_savefile_path()</code> has been called to specify
	the file path, save_restore will manage its own NFS mount.  This allows
	save_restore to recover from a reboot of the NFS host (that is, a stale file
	handle) and from some kinds of tampering with the save_restore directory.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_NumSeqFiles(int numSeqFiles)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreNumSeqFiles</code> (initially 3).
	This is the number of sequenced backup files to be maintained.
	<code>numSeqFiles</code> must be between 0 and 10 inclusive.  
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_RetrySeconds(int seconds)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreRetrySeconds</code> (initially 60; minimum 10).
	If the .sav-file write fails, it will be retried after this interval..
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_SeqPeriodInSeconds(int period)</code>
<dd>Sets the value of <code>(int) save_restoreSeqPeriodInSeconds</code> (initially 60).
	Sequenced backup files will be written with this period.
	<code>period</code> must be 10 or greater.
	<P>This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_status_prefix(char *prefix)</code>
<dd>Specifies the prefix to be used to construct the names of PV's with
	which save_restore reports its status.  If you want autosave to update
	status PVs as it operates, you must call this function and load the
	database save_restoreStatus.db, specifying the same prefix in both
	commands.
	<P>This function must be called before the first call to <code>create_xxx_set()</code>.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreSet_UseStatusPVs(int ok)</code>
<dd>Specifies whether save_restore should report its status to a preloaded set
	of EPICS PV's (contained in the database save_restoreStatus.db).  If the
	argument is '0', then status PV's will not be used.
	<P>This function should be called before the first call to <code>create_xxx_set()</code>.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>void save_restoreShow(int verbose)</code>
<dd>List all the save sets currently being managed by the save_restore task.
	If (verbose != 0), lists the PV's as well.
	<P>This function can be called at any time after iocInit.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_requestfile_path(char *path, char *pathsub)</code>
<dd>Called before create_xxx_set(), this function specifies the path to be
	prepended to request-file names.  <code>pathsub</code>, if present, will be appended
	to <code>path</code>, if present, with a separating '/', whether or not <code>path</code> ends
	or <code>pathsub</code> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one will
	be appended to it.

	<P>You can specify several directories to be searched for request files by
	calling this routine several times.  Directories will be searched in the
	order in which the <code>set_requestfile_path()</code> calls were made.  If you never
	call the routine, the crate's current working directory will be searched.
	If you ever call it, the current directory ("./") will be searched only if
	you've asked for it explicitly.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_pass0_restoreFile(char *save_file, char *macroSubstitutions)</code>

<dd>This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit, before record
	initialization. An unlimited number of files can be specified using calls to this
	function.  If the file name begins with "/", autosave will use it as specified;
	otherwise, autosave will prepend the file path specified to
	<code>set_savefile_path()</code>. The second argument is optional.
	
	<P>Example:
	<code>set_pass0_restoreFile("auto_settings.sav", "P=xxx:")</code>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_pass1_restoreFile(char *save_file, char *macroSubstitutions)</code>

<dd>This function specifies a save file to be restored during iocInit, after record
	initialization. An unlimited number of files can be specified using calls to this
	function. If the file name begins with "/", autosave will use it as specified; otherwise,
	autosave will prepend the file path specified to <code>set_savefile_path()</code>.
	The second argument is optional.

	<P>Example:
	<code>set_pass1_restoreFile("auto_settings.sav", "P=xxx:")</code>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_savefile_name(char *request_file, char *save_file)</code>
<dd>If a save set has already been created for the request file, this
	function will change the save file name.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_savefile_path(char *path, char *pathsub)</code>
<dd>Called before iocInit(), this function specifies the path to be prepended
	to save-file and restore-file names.   <code>pathsub</code>, if present, will be
	appended to <code>path</code>, if present, with a separating '/', whether or not <code>path</code>
	ends or <code>pathsub</code> begins with '/'.  If the result does not end in '/', one
	will be appended to it.
	<P>If save_restore is managing its own NFS mount, this function specifies the
	mount point, and calling it will result in an NFS mount if all other
	requirements have already been met.  If a valid NFS mount already exists,
	the file system will be dismounted and then mounted with the new path name.
	This function can be called at any time.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><dt><code>int set_saveTask_priority(int priority)</code>
<dd>Set the priority of the save_restore task.
